## Purpose and permitted use, cautions for a potential builder of this design
This project was created for historical purposes out of love for historical computing designs and for the purpose of enabling computing enthousiasts with a sufficient level of building and troubleshooting expertise to be able to experience the technology by building and troubleshooting the hardware described in this project. Due to the level of this project, it may be suitable as a project for students to get into. If there are any questions from teachers who like to teach about this technology I would be happy to answer them. It may be really interesting to analyse the elaborate and complex CPU timing and 8 bit to 16 bit data byte translation and DMA mechanisms in an educational setting.

Besides the GPL3 license there are a few warnings and usage restrictions applicable:

No guarantee for any proper operation or suitability for any possible use or purpose is given, using the resulting hardware from this design is purely educational and experimental and not intended for serious applications. Loss of data is likely and to be expected when connecting any storage device or storage media to the resulting system from this design, or when configuring or operating any storage device or media with the system of this design.

When connecting this system to a computer network which contains stored information on it, it is at the sole responsibility and risk of the person making the connection, no guarantee is given against data loss or data corruption, malfunctions or failure of the whole computer network and/or any information contained inside it on other devices and media which are connected to the same network.

When building this project, the builder assumes personal responsibility for troubleshooting it and using the necessary care and expertise to make it function properly as defined by the design. You can email me with questions, but I will reply only if I have time and if I find the question to be valid. Which will probably also lead to an update here. I want to primarily dedicate my time to new project development, I am not able to do any user support, so that's why I provide the elaborate info here which will be expanded if needed.

# Revision 3-D design of a PC/AT mainboard based on CPLD technology  
For background information and previous acknowledgements, please see the Rev1 design repository. 
The information provided here is purely to describe the REV3D designs.  

After designing, building and continued development of the Revision 1 PC/AT design based on the IBM 5170, I reached a final point of development where the current heavily modified Rev1 board has served its purpose in advancing the system to the most fully featured version possible with that board configuration. In order to go further with development, my main goal for this Revision 3D is a deeper level of integration, reducing the external TTL logic, and also further integrating the bus concepts instead of joining the system bus externally using the original tri-state mechanisms.

Initially I intended to implement a much deeper level of integration, however quickly it became apparent that when using CPLDs, I only had a maximum of six possible different OE signals available per package. Even when using very large packages, this same limit still applied. So I needed a few design attempts to reach a proper division of the system into several CPLD packages where the design would be even possible to realize. There were some secondary issues with the quartus compiler/fitter that when a certain package was rather heavily used, let's say above 85% of macrocell logic consumed in the CPLD package, the risk of the quartus compiler not being able to successfully compile the design increased dramatically. In order to prevent the situation where I would be developing a certain CPLD chip in the design and recompiling it, and the compilation no longer being possible, I decided to further distribute the PC/AT design into the 5 CPLD chips this mainboard uses. Particularly the System controller CPLD has been purposely kept rather low in macrocell consumption. The System controller is a logic intensive design with many registers. So this lead to the final design concept using 5 CPLDs. The 5th CPLD, the IO Decoder, has been expanded with a few functions since this package had a substantial number of free pins available. The IO Decoder now also contains a 7 segment POST display driver clocking the data from port 80 of the PC/AT, and it also drives the port B and C for a LPT port, and externally controls a few TTL chips to realize a bidirectional LPT port. Further, the IO decoder CPLD is dividing a few clock signals to drive the system timer and UART, and it implements a "quiet bus" principle on the FDC and UART present on the mainboard.

While examining a TOPCAT mainboard and further looking at other mainboard designs, I noticed the direct attachment of the RAM memory to the CPU data bus. Particilarly, I suspect that this modification arose from the need to run the RAM memory at higher CPU clock speeds and eliminating all transceivers from the memory data bus seems a very good way to increase the CPU memory operation speeds. So this change would also naturally be desirable for our project here. Since the PC/AT has a rather complex data bus control because of 8 <-> 16 bit data byte conversion technology, I cannot simply replicate this design feature, so I intend to look at this matter in more detail after first confirming a normal memory databus system design principle. I have created a set of jumper footprints on the mainboard where we can attach the memory databus directly to the CPU databus using 16 jumper wires. Before hand, the memory databus needs to be deactivated on the EMS controller CPLD in order to prevent bus contention. So we have a means on this mainboard design to develop the system further to hopefully enhance the maximum obtainable CPU clock rate.

The design features a normal XMS memory using two of the four SRAM memory modules, resulting in a maximum of 8MB of XMS/conventional RAM and UMB RAM, and besides this, we can have two EMS SRAM modules. XMS is also used for shadow copying the system BIOS and option ROM BIOS areas as desired. The EMS operation will be further detailed here as soon as this is under test/development. EMS memory is theoretically capable to remap any 16KB block of conventional memory, as well as the D000 and E000 "page frame" segments as well as any other area of below 1MB memory, as desired. To enhance EMS pages in the protected mode memory areas has been avoided because in protected mode we would have the XMS memory available. EMS here is used to enhance the Real mode operation of the 286 with a larger EMS memory pool. 

The System controller also contains cycle control logic which switches the 286 on a lower clock speed for speed sensitive memory and I/O operations. When these areas are detected, an alternate clock mode is implemented dynamically in specific points of the CPU clock cycles in order not to disrupt the clock cycle transitions while the CPU is executing cycles.

The Address driver/decoder CPLD in addition contains DMA specific logic in order not only to generate the system address bus from the CPU but also from the DMACs and a bus Master if present on the slot connector. The Address driver/decoder is also decoding all XMS and EMS memory in the system. For this purpose the Address driver/decoder communicates with the EMS controller in order to determine the selection of XMS or EMS memory for each area of system memory. By default, each page block of system memory is initially programmed to be a default page which is located in the XMS memory chips. When a certain block is reprogrammed in the EMS page registers, it will be remapped into any programmable block inside the EMS memory pool. By programming a memory block back to default, the original memory contents are mapped back into that 16KB page block.

# Status of the project  
Currently the project is fully prepared in the quartus CPLD programming, which have been uploaded here into this repository.  
The PCB designs are finished and the gerber files are uploaded here. I will be uploading the gerber projects into my JLCPCB account and I will be combining an order for several of my projects which I am currently working on. As soon as all projects are uploaded I will create an order for all the PCBs needed.  
All schematics have been uploaded here in PDF format, which includes the mainboard as well as the quartus block design schematics. The BDF files and quartus archives are assigned with 000 initially because these are pre-testing versions.  

The design is currently awaiting testing, debugging and further intensive development, which will be detailed here as soon as this work progresses. The initial goal will be getting a minimal system up and running, after which all the features will be added, retested and developed further.

As soon as the work is progressed, I will also look at featuring an 8 bit mode system ROM chip. This 1 megabit 8 bit ROM chip is attached to the X-data bus and intended to ultimately replace the two 16 bit mode ROMs.

Kind regards,

Rodney
